      <h4> Bienvenue! </h4>

Faites Français contains several resources created to develop your understanding of French: Listen to audio recordings of everyday words and phrases, learn about France and her culture, and immerse yourselves in learning activities. Faites Français is more than a phrasebook. With cultural tips, pronunciation advice and audio, you will feel enriched, being able to travel to and within France more independently. </p>
	    
	    <h4> Culture </h4>
	    <h5> Art </h5>
	    <p>France is well-known for her rich culture, being the home of many revolutionary artists, such as Claude Monet. Surprisingly, French art was inspired by Italy. In fact, France kept a close relation with Italy through their shared love for art. Art in France was taken seriously to the extent of revolutionary Napoleon becoming involved by voicing his favoured form of art, known as neoclassic art. France's influence in art is massive, as French artists introduced new movements coined <i>Impressionism</i> and <i>Symbolism</i>. These art forms were highly critiqued at their time of being introduced to the art world- during the 19th Century- but now they are valued for their uniqueness and bold nature, because they were unlike any other art forms previously introduced.</p>
	    
	    <h5> Literature </h5>
	    <p> French literature derived at a time in which France did not have one national language (French) but multiple languages spoken across the country. The earliest French literary works, like the Matter of France, was inspired by the history of the country, rather than created for fictional entertainment. Like French art, literature in France was innovative, one such example being Madame de la Fayette's <i>La Princesse de Clèves</i>, which is considered to be one of the very first psychological novels in the history of literature.</p>
