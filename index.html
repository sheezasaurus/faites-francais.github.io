      <h4> Bienvenue! </h4>
	    <hr>

	    <h4> Culture </h4>
	    <hr>
	    <h5> Art </h5>
	    <p>France is well-known for her rich culture, being the home of many revolutionary artists, such as Claude Monet. Surprisingly, French art was inspired by Italy. In fact, France kept a close relation with Italy through their shared love for art. Art in France was taken seriously to the extent of revolutionary Napoleon becoming involved by voicing his favoured form of art, known as neoclassic art. France's influence in art is massive, as French artists introduced new movements coined <i>Impressionism</i> and <i>Symbolism</i>. These art forms were highly critiqued at their time of being introduced to the art world- during the 19th Century- but now they are valued for their uniqueness and bold nature, because they were unlike any other art forms previously introduced.</p>
	    
	    <h5> Literature </h5>
	    <p> French literature derived at a time in which France did not have one national language (French) but multiple languages spoken across the country. The earliest French literary works, like the Matter of France, was inspired by the history of the country, rather than created for fictional entertainment. Like French art, literature in France was innovative, one such example being Madame de la Fayette's <i>La Princesse de Clèves</i>, which is considered to be one of the very first psychological novels in the history of literature.</p>
	    
	    <h5> Philosophy </h5>
	    <p> During the 17th Century, René Descartes was a French philosopher that answered questions left ignored by those preceding him, relating to freedom and religion. French philosophers were prominent during the 18th Century, at the time of the Age of Enlightenment when theories were challenged and, quite often, replaced. Indeed, Voltaire emerged with his support for a free trial and freedom of religion, issues that are discussed to this day.</p>	
	    
	    <h4> Demographics </h4>
	    <hr>
	    <p> France is urban, and is also the 20th most populated country in the world, with an estimated population of 66.6 million people, as of January 2016. Individuals from all walks of life reside in France. Those of Scandinavian descent are mostly located in the northwest of France. Though France is accepting of immigration, welcoming 200,000 immigrants yearly, the question of asylum seekers remains prevalent as France reconsiders her Open Door policy.</p>
		    
	    <h4> Economy </h4>
	    <hr>
	    <p> As of 2014, France has the second largest economy in the European Union, and the ninth largest economy in the world. In 2002, the euro became France's national currency, which is now widely used within Europe. The euro replaced the French Franc.</p> 
	    
	    <h4> Politics </h4>
	    <hr>
	    <p> France has a new, but strong nonetheless, democratic tradition, having a history of democratic rule since the 20th Century. The National Assembly takes precedence over the Senate, in the battle for who holds more power and authority. Elections are taking place, as France is due to elect her next President in the spring of 2017.</p>
